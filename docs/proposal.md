# 💡 The Proposal
*"What problem are we actually solving?"*

---

## Problem Statement

Groups make decisions all the time: friends, teams, clubs, and student organizations. Yet those decisions are often inconsistent. The loudest voice tends to win, confidence is rarely measured, and there is no clear record of who was actually right.

Existing tools like group chats and polls account for opinions, not the quality of the decisions being made. As a result, there is no reliable way to tell whether a group decision is better than a single person’s.

## Target Users

**Small, focused groups (5–20 people) making repeat decisions**, such as:

- Students working on group projects  
- Friends debating sports outcomes  
- Clubs deciding on budgets or events  
- Beginner finance or banking clubs practicing risk assessment  

Sports, banking, and similar domains are used as **test environments**.

## Solution Overview

We propose a collaborative decision-making app where users submit:

- **A decision**  
  - Examples: “Approve this loan,” “Team A will win,” “We should fund this event”
- **A confidence score**  
  - Examples: 1–10 scale or a percentage

The system takes all inputs, tracks the outcomes, and uses AI to:

- Flag disagreements within the group  
- Highlight missing perspectives or overlooked context  
- Identify overconfidence or sharp divisions in opinion  

Over time, the app reveals:
- Who is consistently accurate  
- When groups outperform individuals  
- How confidence aligns with real-world outcomes

## 4. Tech Stack Justification

- **Python (Backend)**  
  - Well-suited for data analysis, probability, and AI integration  

- **Web Framework (Frontend)**  
  - Enables a simple, responsive interface for fast group interaction  

- **AI API**  
  - Used as an advisor to provide insight and feedback, not to make final decisions
